                                Canada is witnessing a steady increase in the number of international students shifting to the country. Though an excellent academic record stands as the basis on which admission to Canadian universities is approved, a Canadian student visa is yet another important document that every international student must obtain from the Canadian High Commission to study in the country. It is not a difficult task to obtain the visa if you have all the necessary documents and if you satisfy all the criteria. If you are thinking about studying in Canada, it is important to know about the requirements, eligibility etc. What is equally important to know is the reasons behind the rejection of student visa by the Canadian government. You can read further to know more about it.

                                    <h3>Types of Canada Student Visa </h3>
                                    <p>There is only one Canadian visa type that students can apply for to get admission to a Canadian university. However, there are three categories which you should know about. They are given below.</p>
                                    <ul class="list clearfix">
                                       <li>
                                        <b><b>SDS:</b></b> The Student Direct Stream (SDS) offers express entry to Canada quickly and directly. The visa application process will also be quicker. Several SDS colleges in Canada offer almost all top courses and specialisations.
                                       </li>
                                       <li><b><b>Non-SDS:</b></b> Non-SDS is the general category for all types of visas for studying, working and residing in Canada. Those who missed their chance to apply through SDS can choose Non-SDS. You are not required to show the bank balance in your home country if you apply under this.</li>
                                       <li><b>University Category:</b> The university category is different from Non-SDS in that you need to have an IELTS score of at least 6.0, which is not a requirement for Non-SDS.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                </div>

                                    <h3>What is a Canada Study Permit?</h3>
                                    <p>It should be noted that one study permit can differ from another. A study permit is the permission to study in the country, and almost all international students will require it. However, there are a few exceptions to this. You do not require a study permit if your course duration is equal to less than six months. After you get the study permit, you can enrol in Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs). A DLI is an educational institution that is approved by the territorial or provincial government to admit international students.</p>

                                    <h3>Canada Student Visa Fee</h3>
                                    <p>The Canada student visa fee comes to CAD 150, which may be equal to around NPR 15000. This is based on the current exchange rate, and you should note that this rate is bound to change after a few days. As such, it is essential that you check the exchange rate at the time of application to know the exact rate in Nepali Rupees. </p>
                                    <p>This application fee can be paid both online and offline. All the major online payment methods are accepted. If you plan to pay offline, you can do it with a Demand Draft (DD). You also have the option to pay the fee in cash at the Visa Application Centre (VAC). VAC accepts only cash payments. If you pay the fee at the VAC, you may need to pay an additional service charge which can change depending on the region. You should keep the receipt safe after payment. You will also have to pay an additional biometric fee of CAD 85. The table below shows the types of Canadian visas and their average fees.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Obtaining a Permanent Residency (PR) is one of the primary reasons behind an international student planning to study in Canada. The country has some immigration-friendly policies, which make the entire process easier. You must follow a few criteria to qualify for a PR. The Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has employed Canada's PR point-based system to check how eligible you are to get a PR.
