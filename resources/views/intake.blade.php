                                In Canada, there are mainly intakes for colleges and universities: Fall and Winter.</p>
                                <p>
                                <b>Fall Intake:</b> The Fall intake is the primary intake for most colleges and universities in Canada. It typically starts in September, and applications for the Fall intake usually open between September and January of the previous year. This is the busiest intake, and most of the programs are available in this intake.
                            <p>
                                <b>Winter Intake:</b> The Winter intake is the secondary intake, and it starts in January. Some colleges and universities also offer programs starting in January, especially for certificate and diploma programs. Applications for the Winter intake usually open between February and June of the previous year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Apart from the Fall and Winter intakes, some colleges and universities also offer Summer or Spring intakes, usually for specific programs. These intakes are not as common as the Fall and Winter intakes and are offered by a limited number of institutions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's important to note that the application deadlines for each intake may vary from institution to institution, and it's always best to check the specific deadlines for the program you are interested in. Additionally, some colleges and universities may offer rolling admissions, which means that they accept applications throughout the year, until the program is filled.
                            </p>

                                        The length of the PGWP depends on the length of your study program. If your program was less than 2 years, you will be issued a PGWP that is valid for up to the same length as your study program. If your program was 2 years or longer, you may be eligible for a PGWP that is valid for up to 3 years.
